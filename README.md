 Scenerio

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data.

## ASK

- Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
   - 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

   -  2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

   - 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Lily Moreno (director of marketing and my manager) has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Key tasks

- 1: Identify the business task
   - The main business obejective is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members by understanding how they differ.
     
- 2: Consider key stakeholders
   - The key stakeholders are the Director of Marketing (Lily Moreno), Marketing Analytics team, and Executive team.
 
### Deliverable

- 1: A clear statement of the business task
   - To find the differences between the casual riders and annual members

## PREPARE

- I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends.The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Datasets are available here [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
### Key tasks

   - 1: Download data and store it appropriately.
       - Data has been downloaded and copies have been stored securely on my computer.
   - 2: Identify how it’s organized.
       - The data is in CSV (comma-separated values) format, and there are a total of 13 columns.
   - 3: Sort and filter the data.
      - For this analysis, I will be using data for the year 2019 and 2020.
   - 4: Determine the credibility of the data.
       - For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable me to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. This is public data that I can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But data-privacy issues will prohibit me from using rider’s personally identifiable information and this will prevent me from determining if riders have purchased multiple single passes. All ride ids are unique.

### Deliverable

- 1: A description of all data sources used
   - The main source of all the data used was provided by the [Cyclistic Company](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
